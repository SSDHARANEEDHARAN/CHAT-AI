- 🧠 Specialized knowledge in React & Next.js
- ⚡ Fast and responsive UI
- 🌐 Built with Next.js (React framework)
- 📡 API-driven interaction
- 🎨 Styled for a modern developer-friendly look

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React + Next.js
- **Backend/API**: Gemini API (Google)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS / CSS Modules (adjust as per your project)
- **State Management**: useState, useEffect (or Redux/Zustand if applicable)

## 🚀 Getting Started
